Notes on free.example-4 as of bee0d7d commit 10/4/2016
====

These are screen shots of images I made with plot-level for
free.example-4 in the bee0d7d commit 10/4/2016:

This is a scalar-based experiment.

These images show that with an extreme variation in means of the random
inputs:

1. Sigma doesn't just drop to zero (or whatever limit I impose), but
hops in response to error variation.

2. The hops eventually stabilize to around 3.775.

3. As this happens, the variation in the error value is reduced,
from a range of about [-1.60, 1.75] to roughly inside of [-1,1].

4. There's also a small reduction in the variation of theta/gen-wt.
