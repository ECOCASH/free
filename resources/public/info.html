      <h3>What is it?</h3>

      <h4>Overview</h4>

      <p> This is a simple model from a class of
       models of cognition and brain processes that use methods known as
       "free-energy minimization", "prediction error minimization",
       "predictive coding"
       and/or "predictive processing".  The particular model is a fairly
       literal implementation of a mathematical model described in</p>
       <blockquote>
       Rafal Bogacz, "A tutorial on the free-energy framework for
       modelling perception and learning", <em>Journal of Mathematical
       Psychology</em>, available online 14 December 2015, ISSN
       0022-2496, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2015.11.003.
       (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249615000759)
       </blockquote>
       <p>Specifically, this is the scalar model that Bogacz describes in section 2 
       of his paper.  (There is another version of this software that
       implements the vector/matrix model that Bogacz describes in section 4.)
       </p>

      <h4>Levels and variables</h4>

       <p> In this model there are distinct "levels" of information that
       interact.  The general idea is that there is a "prediction"
       (<em>phi</em>) at one level, scaled by a multiplier
       <em>theta</em>; the result is then is compared some version of
       input data (also <em>phi</em>), but at the at the next level
       down.  The difference between these two values is an "error"
       value <em>epsilon</em>>, which is scaled by the inverse of a
       value <em>sigma</em> to get a scaled error value, which is then
       used to adjust <em>theta</em> and the first <em>phi</em>.</p>

       <p>The version of the model displayed in <em>free</em>
       currently has only three levels--or rather two, level 0 and level 1,
       since the last level, level 2, isn't really a level per se.  It merely
       holds some values needed to make the model run in a simpler way.
       However, by changing one file, <em>free</em> should be able to handle
       a model involving any number of levels.
